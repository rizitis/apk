**emulation** of apk package manager **commands** on a slackware system for the specific repository **only** and for slackware**64-current**

![apk](./apk.svg)

## ?
Personal and *unofficial* binary repository with its own Package Manager, for Slackware64-current.<br>
It is tradition almost every *unofficial* Slackware repository to have its own package manager, so here is mine which work only with this repository **of course** :D<br>

It work like this:<br>
Every Package has
 - package_name.tar.lz4
 - package_name.sha256sum
<br>In `*.lz4` are all metadata and the binary `package_name.t?z`<br>

1. **For install-upgrade a package, apk *before* extract tar.lz4 do:** 
 - compare sha256sum and if its valid continue.<br>
 - extract tar.lz4 and search if dependencies needed...
 - install deps if command was `apk add` or skip them if was `apk fix`
 - check validate `*.t?z` md5sum and if its ok install-upgrade pkg. 

2. **When apk need to print only packages informations from repository (apk search,show,etc...):**
 - It **not** download locally packages 
 - It use curl piped to tar and read all informations on the fly from `*.lz4`. 
 
3. **When apk del need to remove a package from system:**
 - Since apk delete **only** packages that was installed from apk (dont touch slack packages or SBo or anything else)
 - Althought its has its own database for installed packages (apk stats) 
 - It also read systems packages log, so because we want to be 100% sure it will ask you 2 times to confirm before del pkg.
 
4. **I want this tool to work **only** with this repo to not have conflicts with other repos.**
 - But if a dependency is missing from here (probably for size limmit git-lfs not enough), its ok to install it from other REPO using slpkg,sbopkg,slackpkg+ etc...or you can build it from [athos](https://github.com/rizitis/PLASMA_WORLD/tree/main/AthOS) if exist there.
 
5. All packages here are builded using [athos](https://github.com/rizitis/PLASMA_WORLD/blob/main/AthOS/athos) in a Slackware64-current system always updated...

6. This repository is also compatible with [GitVoyager](https://github.com/rizitis/GitVoyager)

7. This repository is also compatible with [captain-slack](https://github.com/rizitis/captain-slack)

8. This repository is also compatible with inxi. <br>

**INFO**: I released a new [Slackware-Commander](https://github.com/rizitis/Slackware-Commander) so all helpers scripts etc... to be in one place.

### !
This is not apk-tools (Alpine Package Keeper) or  Chimera`s next-generation version 3.<br>
This apk is a simple bash script which was written from scratch to work exclusively with this repository. <br>
Repo files can be found [here](./repo_contents.json)

#### %
- Dependencies: None in full Slackware installation. Else:`"bash curl pkgtools"`
- To install apk (meaning the package manager):
  - As regular user paste in terminal all this ugly cmd line:
    ```
    mkdir /tmp/apk && cd /tmp/apk || exit && curl -L -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rizitis/apk/refs/heads/main/apk && curl -L -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rizitis/apk/refs/heads/main/apk.env && curl -L -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rizitis/apk/refs/heads/main/repositories
    ```
  - Then be root (su -l) and command:
    ```
    cd /tmp/apk || exit && mkdir -p /etc/apk && cp ./apk.env ./repositories /etc/apk/ && cp ./apk /usr/local/sbin/ && chmod +x /usr/local/sbin/apk
    ```
  - Finally always as root run the update command 2 times: `apk update` to connect apk with remote repository and again `apk update` to update pakcages lists.
  - To blacklist packages for slackpkg, as root: ```echo "[0-9]+_rtz" >> /etc/slackpkg/blacklist```
- HowTo use apk, always as root command: `apk --help`
```

> this is not SBo/ponce or conraid or alienbob repos<br>
I m just having fun here and build packages I need and **not exist** there most of times.<br>
If Slackware-stable was released every year and not when its ready, probably all these packages should be in SBo by me.<br>
But now most of them do not run or build properly in Slackware-stable so they will not be accepted in SBo<br>
Thats all, happy slacking... 

> I can not upload large files (>100MB) due to github limits.
